/**
 * <p>This bit of appengine magic hooks into the ApiProxy and does the heavy lifting of
 * making the TriggerFuture<?> work.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This class maintains a thread local list of all the outstanding Future<?> objects
 * that have pending triggers.  When a Future<?> is done and its trigger is executed,
 * it is removed from the list.  At various times (anytime an API call is made) the registered
 * futures are checked for doneness and processed.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The AsyncCacheFilter is necessary to guarantee that any pending triggers are processed
 * at the end of the request.  A future GAE SDK which allows us to hook into the Future<?>
 * creation process might make this extra Filter unnecessary.</p>
